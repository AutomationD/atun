# Atun - AWS Tagged Tunnel

Secure tunneling doesn't have to be hard or annoying: `atun` is a tiny cli tool which works based on remote configuration. 
It uses tags to define hosts and ports forwarding endpoints.

::: tip
While the tool works, it is still in development and versions before 1.0.0 might have breaking changes.
Be ready that commits might be squashed/reset and tags might be rewritten until 1.0.0
